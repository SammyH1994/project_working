						<h4>Description of data</h4>
						<p> As is described on the homepage, more baby's in Limburg are born with birth defects than in the rest of the Netherlands. </p>					
						<p> Researchers are not sure what causes this effect.
						<br>Therefore, this visualization has attempted to explore what potentially influences this difference, by creating three visualizations.
						<br>The first visualization gives an idea of the population size among the different provinces of the Netherlands.
						<br>As one can see, the population size has increased by 600,000 people over the last 10 years. The distribution of this population has, however, not changed over the provinces.
						<br>In addition, it becomes clear that Limburg's population size is average. Zuid-Holland is the most densely populated, whereas Zeeland has the smallest population.</p>
						<p>When a province is clicked, we can further compare Limburg to the chosen province in the population pyramid and the barchart. We can also use the slider to change the year.
						<br>Looking at the pyramid, perhaps the most interesting finding is that Limburg seems to have a smaller percentage of baby's and children from the age of 0 to 5.
						<br>In the barchart, you can also compare Limburg to other provinces on several topics.</p>
						<p>Interpreting these results is up to the reader!</p>
						<p>Do you see anything that might be of influence in causing more baby's to be born with birth defects in Limburg?</p>
